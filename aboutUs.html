            Kathode energy solutions is a Delhi based start-up company that specializes in Alternate Energy and electric vehicle. 
            Our aim is to help shift world from fossil-based energy to renewables. <p>
            For our latest project we are retro fitting conventional fuel cars to electric. By doing this we give our customers
            chance to get the top-class driving experience while going green and making the most out of technology.
            Kathode is efficient as we have an alternate route to upcycle the damaged product that otherwise would be discarded.<p>
            Due to COVID-19 we had to cease operations. And as days went by we noticed more and more complaints of sub-standard Personal Protective Equipment kits being supplied to doctors. 
            So in order to tackle with this problem, our team got to work and we sourced and manufactured PPE kits with all relevant certifications which meet all national and international standards. 
            But being a start-up we are short on resources so we need all the help we can get, so we can provide the best to our health care workers who are on the front line fighting COVID-19.</p>
